# Hi, my name is Israel

I am from Granada (Spain). Usually, my nick is iblancasa (**I**srael **BLANCAS** **√Å**lvarez).

I love all the things related to technology
(specially, software development). For this reason, spend my
free time working on open source projects, attending to conferences
or researching about new technologies. Linux, Python, Docker and GitHub user.

Currently, I am working on
[Real Time-Innovations](http://www.rti.com/) as Software Engineer. Also, I am organizer at [Google Developer Group Granada](http://www.gdggranada.com.com/)

Also, I am musician in a special kind of music band.
