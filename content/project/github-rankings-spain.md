# GitHubRankingsSpain

## What is this?
This repository contains a set of rankings:
* One of them is generated for every Spanish province.
* With all the rankings of a region (
autonomous community or the complete country), the ranking of this region is generated.

**What kind of rankings?**: It sorts GitHub users by the number of
**public contributions** and groups them by the location in their profile.

## How is this dataset generated?

This repository contains the results of [GitHubSpanishRankingGenerator](https://github.com/iblancasa/GitHubSpanishRankingGenerator).

To generate the rankings, it is necessary to
use [GitHubCity](https://github.com/iblancasa/GitHubCity), which is
also available at [Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/githubcity/).
