[Go to the source code of the project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iblancasa/GitHubCity).

This is a small library which gets all GitHub users given a city. Original idea is [Top-GitHub-Users-Data](https://github.com/JJ/top-github-users-data) by [@JJ](https://github.com/JJ), an adaptation of [top-github-users](https://github.com/paulmillr/top-github-users) from [@paulmillr](https://github.com/paulmillr/).

This is an amazing Python library to study the GitHub community in a
location. You can get all the GitHub users from a given location and
obtain some data. For instance, you can generate one ranking
like
[this ranking with the users from Spain (and its provinces)](https://github.com/iblancasa/GitHubRankingsSpain).
