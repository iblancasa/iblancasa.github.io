abstract = "Creating rankings might seem like a vain exercise in belly-button gazing, even more so for people so unlike that kind of things as programmers. However, in this paper we will try to prove how creating city (or province) based rankings in Spain has led to all kind of interesting effects, including increased productivity and community building. We describe the methodology we have used to search for programmers residing in a particular province focusing on those where most population is concentrated and apply different measures to show how these communities differ in structure, number and productivity."
